## Installation
    npm install spritegen

### Installation Help
    Spritegen requires node-canvas, which requires Cairo. To install Cairo on your system please follow the first portion of the [Wiki](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages) provided by the guys at LearnBoost.
    Ignore the section that describes how to install node-canvas. Currently node-canvas only supports node-waf for a direct npm install. Spritegen is using a gyp version of the repo, which I forked.

## More to Come!
    Examples and more documentation to come within the next few days.
